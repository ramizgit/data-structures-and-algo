How to decide when to use left <= right and when just left < right in binary search

Here’s a simple decision checklist you can memorize:

Question	If YES → use
Am I checking == target inside loop?	left <= right
Do I return immediately when found?	left <= right
Am I finding a boundary, minimum, maximum, or peak?	left < right
Do I compare mid with mid+1 or mid-1?	left < right
Do I want loop to stop when pointers meet?	left < right
Do I want loop to stop when pointers cross?	left <= right
